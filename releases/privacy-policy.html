  <h1>VibeLearner – Privacy & Compliance Policy</h1>
  <p><strong>Effective Date:</strong> September 12, 2025</p>

  <h2>1. Introduction</h2>
  <p>VibeLearner ("we," "our," or "us") provides a platform for users to create and store personalized learning content. We respect your privacy and comply with applicable data protection laws, including Google Play Developer Program Policies and GDPR/CCPA principles.</p>

  <h2>2. Information We Collect</h2>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>Account Data (via Firebase Authentication):</strong> Email address, display name (if provided), Firebase-generated User ID (UID), account creation time and last login time.</li>
    <li><strong>User-Generated Content (via Cloud Firestore):</strong> Course titles and course content you create, timestamps (created/updated), optional preferences (e.g., dark/light theme, notifications), usage counters (if enabled).</li>
    <li><strong>Optional Analytics (via Firebase Analytics/Crashlytics):</strong> Non-personal device and usage data for performance monitoring and app improvement. We do not link analytics to your identity.</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>3. How We Use Your Information</h2>
  <p>We use the above information only to create and manage your account, store and retrieve your course content, improve app stability, detect crashes, and analyze usage (if analytics are enabled), and to communicate essential service updates or respond to support requests.</p>

  <h2>4. Data Sharing and Disclosure</h2>
  <p>We do not sell or rent personal information. Data is shared only with trusted service providers (Google Firebase and Google Cloud) strictly to operate the app. We may disclose information if required by law or to protect rights and safety.</p>

  <h2>5. Data Storage and Security</h2>
  <p>All data is stored in Google Firebase (Authentication & Firestore), secured with industry-standard encryption in transit and at rest. Access is controlled via strict Firestore security rules to ensure users can only access their own data.</p>

  <h2>6. Your Rights</h2>
  <p>You can request account or data deletion, or corrections, by contacting
    <a href="mailto:dojoga.web3@gmail.com">dojoga.web3@gmail.com</a>. We will respond within a reasonable time.</p>

  <h2>7. Children's Privacy</h2>
  <p>VibeLearner is not directed at children under 13. We do not knowingly collect personal information from children. If we learn of such collection, we promptly delete it.</p>

  <h2>8. Changes to This Policy</h2>
  <p>We may update this policy to reflect app changes or legal requirements. Updates will be posted on this page with a new "Effective Date."</p>
